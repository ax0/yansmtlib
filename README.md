# Yet Another Noir Sparse Merkle Tree Library
## Description
This library provides sparse Merkle tree (SMT) primitives in Noir, specifically verification of proofs of (non-)membership and insertions/deletions/updates given an appropriate path down the tree. It aims to be compatible with the Circom implementation.
